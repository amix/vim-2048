Play 2048 in your Vim :)
========================

You need to install [term2048](https://github.com/bfontaine/term2048) and your Vim has to support Python.

Installing term2048 is quite easy:

    $ pip install term2048

Install the vim-2048 is also easy if you use something like [vim-pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen):

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/amix/vim-2048

Afer this is done simply call Play2048 to play (from command mode):

    :Play2048
    
Enjoy!!
